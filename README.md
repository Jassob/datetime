# DateTime

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stackbuilders/datetime.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stackbuilders/datetime) [![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/datetime-sb.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/datetime-sb)

The original DateTime package on Hackage hasn't been updated in a long
time, and it won't build on GHC 7.10. This fork by Stack Builders, on
Hackage as datetime-sb, implements a minor patch so that it builds on
GHC 7.10 and previous versions.
